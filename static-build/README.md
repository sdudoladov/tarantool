# Tarantool static build tooling

These files help to prepare environment for building Tarantool
statically. And builds it.

## Prerequisites

Please install following tools and libraries that will
be necessary for building and testing:
* git
* A C/C++ compiler.

  Ordinarily, this is gcc and g++ version 4.6 or later. On Mac OS X, this
  is Clang version 3.2+.
* cmake
* make
* Python and modules.

  Python interpreter is not necessary for building Tarantool itself, unless you
  intend to use the â€œRun the test suite". For all platforms, this is python
  version 3.x. You need the following Python modules:
  * pyyaml
  * gevent
  * six

### Here is an examples for your OS:

CentOS:

```bash
yum install -y \
    git perl gcc cmake make gcc-c++ libstdc++-static \
    python3-msgpack python3-yaml python3-six python3-gevent
```

Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
apt-get install -y \
    build-essential cmake make coreutils sed \
    python3 python3-msgpack python3-yaml python3-six python3-gevent
```

MacOS:

Before you start please install default Xcode Tools by Apple:

```bash
sudo xcode-select --install
sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

Install brew using command from
[Homebrew repository instructions](https://github.com/Homebrew/inst)

After that run next script:

```bash
brew install cmake
pip install --user --force-reinstall -r test-run/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
cmake .
make -j
ctest -V
```

## Customize your build

If you want to customise build, you need to set `CMAKE_TARANTOOL_ARGS` variable

### Usage

There are three types of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`:
* Debug - default
* Release
* RelWithDebInfo

And you want to build tarantool with RelWithDebInfo:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_TARANTOOL_ARGS="-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo" .
```
